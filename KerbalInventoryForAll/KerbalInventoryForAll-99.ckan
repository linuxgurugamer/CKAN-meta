    "abstract": "Mod that adds Kerbal 1.11 Inventories to all Command Pods including 3rd party pods, as well as adding inventories to any parts which already have a KIS Inventory - both from KIS mod and other mods which add KIS inventories (like USI mods).  This mod may no longer be needed as other Mod authors update their mods to include Stock inventories from Kerbal 1.11. As this happens this mod will simply skip the newly updated mods and only add Inventory to mods that do not natively support it yet.",
